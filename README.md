# LogParser
Simple log parser tool with interactive charting display

Takes a sample log file as input then process it to regroup data amongst server, processes and dates and computes processing times.
The output is a CSV file or an interacting chart (using jfreechart).

This tool's quite old, at the time it was created no cool JS lib existed to plot direct HTML5 charts...
